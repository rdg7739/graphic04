Goals of this project:
Understand how to apply the knowledge that I learned in class to solve real
world problems. 
This project helped to understand how colors affect
interpretation of scientific data.
This is also the project that the instructor didn't provide any supporting code 
to give maximum flexibility to start engineering own computer graphics program.
